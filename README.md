MasterOfThieves
===============
Master of Thieves was a game written for my four week long game design course.  The game was put together by a group of
three of us who contributed in different ways over a course of three days.  Originally a "tribute to Nintendo", all 
sprites and themes (music) have been replaced with custom sprites and a custom theme (more to come in time).

----------
Please note: the original code was written in three days for a college game development course.  It uses some bad
coding habits, as well as some hacked together code to make things work.  Originally I had plans to start working on this again, but as I started doing so I decided to start from scratch.  With that being said, I've begun [redoing the game](https://github.com/xnifty/mot-unity) in C# using Unity (please note the repository may not be public at this time; if it is not, please try again soon and it should be).
