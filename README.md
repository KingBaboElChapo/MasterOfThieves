MasterOfThieves
===============

Master of Thieves was a game written for my four week long game design course.  The game was put together by a group of
three of us who contributed in different ways.  Although nearly all of the sprites (except the character, bricks, and spikes)
are copyrighted, we decided in this version to be a tribute to Nintendo and have some fun.  I'll upload the game design
document at a later time, which contains everything you would need concerning all of this.

Currently
---------
* Currently am fixing up level loading and music / themes depending on instance.
* attempting to move completely away from global variables

Issues
------
Known issues include:
* Music not playing
* Failing to load level / theme
* Deaths are handled in a crappy way (globals)
* others I cannot remember

Important
----------
Please note: all Nintendo, Rare, and Sega sprites and music are copyrighted by their respected owners and/or creators
and are being used in this game; no monetary gain is being made from this game and we are in no way profitting from
the use of the stated themes, music, sprites, or anything of the.

If you download the game or make additions or changes without the changing of the copyrighted material you are agreeing
to not use the material to gain monetary value of any kind (and/or compensation).

We will be changing out the themes, music, and sprites at a later time.
