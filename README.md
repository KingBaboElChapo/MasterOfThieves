MasterOfThieves
===============
Master of Thieves was a game written for my four week long game design course.  The game was put together by a group of
three of us who contributed in different ways over a course of three days.  Originally a "tribute to Nintendo", all 
sprites and themes (music) have been replaced with custom sprites and a custom theme (more to come in time).

Issues
------
* Game always registers player as "jumping", breaking animations
* Level design is awkward due to using text files
* Please submit any issues through [GitHub tracking](https://github.com/xNifty/MasterOfThieves/issues)

Important
----------
Please note: the original code was written in three days for a college game development course.  It uses some bad
coding habits, as well as some hacked together code to make things work.  With that being said, I have decided to begin
working on rewriting the game, which will include a multitude of changes to the code and file structure.

If you wish to help, please submit a pull request with your changes.  Thanks!
