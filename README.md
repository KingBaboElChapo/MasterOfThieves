MasterOfThieves
===============

Master of Thieves was a game written for my four week long game design course.  The game was put together by a group of
three of us who contributed in different ways over a course of three days.  Originally a "tribute to Nintendo", all sprites
and themes (music) have been replaced with custom sprites and a custom theme (more to come in time).  The game is now
only worked on by myself in my free time, but it does still recieve updates periodically.

Currently
---------
* Rewriting collision (most important!)
* Attempting to redo some things that are implemented badly (were done to make things work quickly)
* Writing pseudo-code for guards
* Cleaning useless sections of the code - kind of an "always in progress" thing, so always on the list

Issues
------
Known issues include:
* Game always registers playing as "jumping" - makes using animations hard (currently being worked on)

Wiki coming soon; please submit issue tickets as needed so I can fix things


Important
----------
Please note: all Nintendo themes and sprites have been removed and replaced with ones designed by us (original game
developers) and the theme replaced by one done by a friend (no link to him as of now).  The game is entirely open source
and I hope in time others will begin to help with development.

I am an extremely novice programmer (as seen in my bad programming habits / mistakes) but I do enjoy it greatly, even when
I get really frustrated.  I have a good network of friends who help me with issues that I am unable to solve on my
own and for that I am thankful.

As a background note, I am completely pro open-source and 99% of anything I ever do (on my own) will be open source.  Obviously,
this cannot carry over into anything I may do in the future with a business and/or company.
